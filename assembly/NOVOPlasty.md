# Readme for running NOVOPlasty.sh on Cannon

NOVOPlasty.sh is an sbatch file to assemble a mitogenome from NGS data. The script calls the NOVOPlasty perl script and you provide a config.txt file that contains the paths to: 1) a reference seed, either a complete mitogenome or mtDNA fragment of a closely-related species, 2) your fastq files.
